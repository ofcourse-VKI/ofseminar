<h1> OpenFOAM seminars</h1>

###

<h2> Organised by the von Karman Institute for Fluid dynamics</h2>

###

We are organizing a series of periodic seminars (abour every 3 months) to share our knowledge and learn from other OpenFOAM users.

The events aim to bring together OpenFOAM users as well as those interested in potential applications of the code, both for academic and industrial purposes. 

Each seminar is organized in two main parts:
- A presentation of a research group/company willing to share their expertise and their applications of the OpenFOAM software. 
We want to give different OpenFOAM users/research group/companies the possibility of presenting their work.
If you are willing to present your research group in a general way (20-30 minutes presentation), let us know on https://github.com/ofcourse-VKI/ofseminar/discussions or sending an e-mail to ofcourse@vki.ac.be
- A demo or a tutorial session on a test case in OpenFOAM. 
We are interested in applications, implementations, post-processing tools, meshing strategies, coupling with external software, anything that you want to share with the OpenFOAM community. If you are willing to create a tutorial/demo (about 1 hour), please propose your idea on https://github.com/ofcourse-VKI/ofseminar/discussions/categories/ideas or send an e-mail to ofcourse@vki.ac.be

Next seminar will be held on the 4th of July 2024.
